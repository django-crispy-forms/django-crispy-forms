CHANGELOG
=========

For 0.8.0

 * Elevated Miguel Araujo to project lead!
 * Based on @issackelly's and @johnthedebs's work a template called `betterform` has been added for supporting @carljm's form-utils BetterForms.
 * FormHelper's method get_attr has been renamed to get_attributes
 * uni_form_tags has been split into two different files: `uni_form_tags` and `uni_form_filters`.
 * Removing i18n tags from the templates, as they are not necessary anymore.
 * Removed all the internationalized hardcoded text, in favor of template variables: `form_error_title` and `formset_error_title`, bot can be set as helper's attributes.
 * as_uni_errors filter can now render formset's non_form_errors uni-form way.
 * Moved setup filter to use STATIC_URL instead of MEDIA_URL
 * Added the possibility to specify a helper for formsets too.
 * Renamed media directory to static, to be compatible with Django 1.3 staticfiles.
 * Added a form_style Helper attribute for setting global style of a form: inline or default.
 * Turning HTML into a context aware field, having form as a context variable and working as a Django template.
 * Turning Layout and Fieldset fields into lists, so that they can be changed dynamically.
 * Changing formHints from paragraphs to divs, so ul or ol can be placed within.
 * Removing slugify filter from form ids, so they can be set as user's preferences.
 * Added CSS class 'asteriskField' for asterisks. Added CSS class 'fieldRequired' for required input labels. 
 * FAIL_SILENTLY setting has been added for making django-uni-form log errors and fail silently, based on Adam Cupiał's work.
 * Several bug fixes in MultiField.
 * Added unicode support for layout field names and improved error handling.
 * Refactored testing system and raised testing coverage.
 * Clean part of the code base and comments. All old CSRF code for supporting old versions of Django has been removed.
 * Refactored BasicNode for better readability and reducing lines of code. 
 * Added formsets support based on Victor Nagy's (nagyv) and Antti Kaihola's (akahiola) work.
 * Bug fix in {% uni_form %} tag that didn't work without a helper and it was meant to be optional.
 * CSS classes can be set in Submit buttons.
 * Thanks to J. Javier Maestro (jjmaestro) now we can set ids and classes for Fieldset, MultiField, Row and Column.
 * Thanks to Richard Marko (sorki) changed CSS class of PasswordInput widget.
 * Removing Toggle class as it wasn't being used anywhere.
 * Moved BaseInput to helpers and removed util.py file.
 * Removed {% uni_form_jquery %} tag
 * Removed `namify` function from tags, as It wasn't being used anywhere.

 * Improved internal documentation
 * form methods generated by FormHelper are in lowercase (http://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form/issues#issue/20)
 * Thanks to Nagy Viktor added form_tag attribute to FormHelper. Now you can use the uni_form tag without the leading and trailing form tags.
 * Thanks for Alison Rowland for giving django-uni-form sphinx docs
 * Incorporated uni-form 1.4 by Dragan Babic
 * Provide better adherence to uni-form specification of error messages
 * mirumee provided some great work for making FormHelper more subclassable.
 * django-uni-form 0.8 and higher lays out the HTML for the uni_form tag differently. The errorMsg div is now outside the fieldset as it should be.
 * Thanks to Casper S. Jensen django-uni-form now supports 1.2 style csrf_token.
 * csrf_token does not break earlier versions of Django. This will change when no version of django does not support csrf_token.
 * Thanks to j0hnsmith changed {{ error }} to {{ error|safe }} so that html (eg links) can be added to error messages.
 * Thanks to j0hnsmith changed {{ field.label }} to {{ field.label|safe }} so that html (eg  links) can be added to field labels
 * Kudos to Stepan Rakhimov fixed an admin datetime issue.
 * Thanks to patrys (Patryk Zawadzki) FormHelper class is now easily subclass-able.
 * Sorki (Richard Marko) made it so things work better in direct_to_template.

For 0.7.0

 * Removed a <hr /> from the layout module.
 * Changed templatetags/uni_form.py to templatetags/uni_form_tags.py. Yes, this breaks backwards compatibility but fixes a namespace problems in Django with naming a templatetag library after the parent application.
 * Changed form_action attribute to accept not just named URLs but also any old URL.
 * Added in uni_form_setup tag.
 * Added tests
 * Added several new contributors including Dragan Babic
 * Added Danish language translation

.. _`form helpers`:

================
{% crispy %} tag
================

django-crispy-forms implements a class called ``FormHelper`` that defines the form rendering behavior. Helpers give you a way to control form attributes and its layout, doing this in a programatic way using Python. This way you write as little HTML as possible, and all your logic stays in the forms and views files.

Fundamentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the rest of this document we will use the following example form of how to use a helper. This form is in charge of gathering some user information::

    class ExampleForm(forms.Form):
        like_website = forms.TypedChoiceField(
            label = "Do you like this website?",
            choices = ((1, "Yes"), (0, "No")),
            coerce = lambda x: bool(int(x)),
            widget = forms.RadioSelect,
            initial = '1',
            required = True,
        )

        favorite_food = forms.CharField(
            label = "What is you favorite food?",
            max_length = 80,
            required = True,
        )

        favorite_color = forms.CharField(
            label = "What is you favorite color?",
            max_length = 80,
            required = True,
        )

        favorite_number = forms.IntegerField(
            label = "Favorite number",
            required = False,
        )

        notes = forms.CharField(
            label = "Additional notes or feedback",
            required = False,
        )
        
Let's see how helpers works step by step, with some examples explained. First you will need to import ``FormHelper``::

    from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper

Your helper can be a class level variable or an instance level variable, if you don't know what this means you might want to read the article "`Be careful how you use static variables in forms`_". As a rule of thumb, if you are not going to manipulate a `FormHelper` in your code, like in a view, you should be using a static helper, otherwise you should be using an instance level helper. If you still don't understand the subtle differences between both, use an instance level helper, because you won't end up suffering side effects. As in the next steps I will show you how to manipulate the form helper, so we will create an instance level helper. This is how you would do it::

    from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
    
    class ExampleForm(forms.Form):
        [...]
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.helper = FormHelper()
            super(ExampleForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

As you can see you need to override the constructor and call the base class constructor using ``super``. This helper doesn't set any form attributes, so it's useless. Let's see how to set up some basic `FormHelper` attributes::

    from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
    from crispy_forms.layout import Submit

    class ExampleForm(forms.Form):
        [...]
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.helper = FormHelper()
            self.helper.form_id = 'id-exampleForm'
            self.helper.form_class = 'blueForms'
            self.helper.form_method = 'post'
            self.helper.form_action = 'submit_survey'

            self.helper.add_input(Submit('submit', 'Submit'))
            super(ExampleForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

Note that we are importing a class called ``Submit`` that is a layout object. We will see what layout objects are in detail later on, for now on let's just say that this adds a submit button to our form, so people can send their survey.

We've also done some helper magic. ``FormHelper`` has a list of attributes that can be set, that effect mainly form attributes. Our form will have as DOM id ``id-exampleForm``, it will have as DOM CSS class ``blueForms``, it will use http ``POST`` to send information and its action will be set to ``reverse(submit_survey)``. 

Let's see how to render the form in a template. Supposing we have the form in the template context as ``example_form``, we would render it doing::

    {% load crispy_forms_tags %}
    {% crispy example_form example_form.helper %}

Notice that the ``{% crispy %}`` tags expects two parameters: first the form variable and then the helper. In this case we use the ``FormHelper`` attached to the form, but you could also create a ``FormHelper`` instance and pass it as a context variable. Most of the time, you will want to use the helper attached. Note that if you name your ``FormHelper`` attribute ``helper`` you will only need to do::

    {% crispy form %}

This is exactly the html that you would get::

    <form action="/submit/survey/" class="uniForm blueForms" method="post" id="id-exampleForm">
        <div style='display:none'>
            <input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='a643fab735d5ce6377ff456e73c4b1af' />
        </div>
        <fieldset>
            <legend></legend>
            <div id="div_id_like_website" class="ctrlHolder">
                <label for="id_like_website" class="requiredField">¿Do you like this website?<span class="asteriskField">*</span></label>
                <ul>
                    <li><label for="id_like_website_0"><input checked="checked" name="like_website" value="1" id="id_like_website_0" type="radio" class="radioselect" /> Yes</label></li>
                    <li><label for="id_like_website_1"><input value="0" type="radio" class="radioselect" name="like_website" id="id_like_website_1" /> No</label></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="div_id_favorite_food" class="ctrlHolder">
                <label for="id_favorite_food" class="requiredField">What is you favorite food?<span class="asteriskField">*</span></label>
                <input id="id_favorite_food" class="textinput textInput" type="text" name="favorite_food" maxlength="80" />
            </div>
            <div id="div_id_favorite_color" class="ctrlHolder">
                <label for="id_favorite_color" class="requiredField">What is you favorite color?<span class="asteriskField">*</span></label>
                <input id="id_favorite_color" class="textinput textInput" type="text" name="favorite_color" maxlength="80" />
            </div>
            <div id="div_id_favorite_number" class="ctrlHolder">
                <label for="id_favorite_number">Favorite number</label>
                <input id="id_favorite_number" type="text" name="favorite_number" class="textinput textInput" />
            </div>
            <div id="div_id_notes" class="ctrlHolder">
                <label for="id_notes">Additional notes or feedback</label>
                <input id="id_notes" type="text" name="notes" class="textinput textInput" />
            </div>
        </fieldset>
        <div class="buttonHolder">
            <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" class="submit submitButton" id="submit-id-submit" />
        </div>
    </form>

What you'll get is the form rendered as HTML with awesome bits. Specifically...

 * Opening and closing form tags, with id, class, action and method set as in the helper::
    
    <form action="/submit/survey/" class="uniForm blueForms" method="post" id="id-exampleForm">
        [...]
    </form>
    
 * Django's CSRF controls::
 
    <div style='display:none'>
        <input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='a643fab735d5ce6377ff456e73c4b1af' />
    </div>
 
 * Submit button::

    <div class="buttonHolder">
        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" class="submit submitButton" id="submit-id-submit" />
    </div>


Manipulating a helper in a view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's see how we could change any helper property in a view::

    @login_required()
    def inbox(request, template_name):
        example_form = ExampleForm()
        redirect_url = request.GET.get('next')

        # Form handling logic
        [...]
 
        if redirect_url is not None:
            example_form.helper.form_action = reverse('submit_survey') + '?next=' + redirectUrl
        
        return render_to_response(template_name, {'example_form': example_form}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))

We are changing ``form_action`` helper property in case the view was called with a ``next`` GET parameter.


Rendering several forms with helpers 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often we get asked: "How do you render two or more forms, with their respective helpers, using ``{% crispy %}`` tag, without having ``<form>`` tags rendered twice?" Easy, you need to set ``form_tag`` helper property to ``False`` in every helper::

    self.helper.form_tag = False

Then you will have to write a little of html code surrounding the forms::

    <form action="{% url submit_survey %}" class="uniForm" method="post">
        {% crispy first_form %}
        {% crispy second_form %}
    </form>

You can read a list of :ref:`helper attributes` and what they are for.


Make django-crispy-forms fail loud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default when django-crispy-forms encounters errors, it fails silently, logs them and continues working if possible. A settings variable called ``CRISPY_FAIL_SILENTLY`` has been added so that you can control this behavior. If you want to raise exceptions instead of logging, telling you what’s going on when you are developing in debug mode, you can set it to::

    CRISPY_FAIL_SILENTLY = not DEBUG


Rendering formsets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``{% crispy %}`` tag supports formsets rendering too. All the previous stated things apply to formsets the same way. Imagine you create a formset using the previous ``ExampleForm`` form::

    from django.forms.models import formset_factory

    ExampleFormset = formset_factory(ExampleForm, extra = 3)
    example_formset = ExampleFormset()

This is how you would render the formset. Note that this time you need to specify the helper explicitly::

    {% crispy formset formset.form.helper %}

Note that you can still use a helper (in this case we are using the helper of the form used for building the formset). The main difference here is that helper attributes are applied to the form structure, while the layout is applied to the formset’s forms. Rendering formsets injects some extra context in the layout rendering so that you can do things like::

    HTML("{% if forloop.first %}Message displayed only in the first form of a formset forms list{% endif %}",
    Fielset("Item {{ forloop.counter }}", 'field-1', [...])

Basically you can access a ``forloop`` Django node, as if you were rendering your formsets forms using a for loop.


.. _`helper attributes`:

Helper attributes you can set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**form_method = 'POST'**
    Specifies form method attribute. You can see it to ‘POST’ or ‘GET’. Defaults to ‘POST’

**form_action**
    Applied to the form action attribute. Can be a named url in your URLconf that can be executed via the {% url %} template tag. Example: ‘show_my_profile’. In your URLconf you could have something like::

        url(r'^show/profile/$', 'show_my_profile_view', name = 'show_my_profile')

    You can also point it to a URL ‘/whatever/blabla/’.

**form_id**
    Specifies form DOM id attribute. If no id provided then no id attribute is created on the form.

**form_class**
    String containing separated CSS clases to be applied to form class attribute. The form will always have by default ‘uniForm’ class.

**form_tag = True**
    It specifies if ``<form></form>`` tags should be rendered when using a Layout. If set to ``False`` it renders the form without the ``<form></form>`` tags. Defaults to ``True``.

**form_error_title**
    If you are rendering a form using ``{% crispy %}`` tag and it has ``non_field_errors`` to display, they are rendered in a div. You can set the title of the div with this attribute. Example: “Form Errors”.

**formset_error_title**
    If you are rendering a formset using ``{% crispy %}`` tag and it has ``non_form_errors`` to display, they are rendered in a div. You can set the title of the div with this attribute. Example: “Formset Errors”.

**form_style = 'default'**
    Helper attribute for uni_form template pack. Uni-form has two different form styles built-in. You can choose which one to use, setting this variable to ``default`` or ``inline``.

**form_show_errors = True**
    Default set to ``True``. It decides wether to render or not form errors. If set to ``False``, form.errors will not be visible even if they happen. You have to manually render them customizing your template. This allows you to customize error output.

**render_unmentioned_fields = False**
    By default django-crispy-forms renders the layout specified if it exists strictly, which means it only renders what the layout mentions, unless your form has ``Meta.fields`` and ``Meta.exclude`` defined, in that case it uses them. If you want to render unmentioned fields in the layout, for example if you are worried about forgetting mentioning them you have to set this property to ``True``. It defaults to ``False``.

**help_text_inline = False**
    Use this helper attribute to set if help texts if you are using bootstrap template pack, should be rendered ``help-inline`` or using ``help-block``. By default ``help-block`` is used.


=======
Layouts 
=======

Fundamentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django-crispy-forms defines another powerful class called ``Layout``, which allows you to change the way the form fields are rendered. This allows you to set the order of the fields, wrap them in divs or other structures, add html, set ids, classes or attributes to whatever you want, etc. And all that without writing a custom form template, using programmatic layouts. Just attach the layout to a helper, layouts are optional, but probably the most powerful thing django-crispy-forms has to offer.

A ``Layout`` is constructed by layout objects, which can be thought of as form components. You assemble your layout using those. For the time being, your choices are: ``ButtonHolder``, ``Button``, ``Div``, ``Row``, ``Column``, ``Fieldset``, ``MultiField``, ``HTML``, ``TemplateInclude``, ``Hidden``, ``Reset``, ``Submit``, ``Field``, ``AppendedText``, ``PrependedText``, ``FormActions``.

All these components are explained later in :ref:`layout objects`. What you need to know now about them is that every component renders a different template and has a different purpose. Let’s write a couple of different layouts for our form, continuing with our form class example (note that the full form is not shown again).

Some layout objects are specific to a template pack. For example ``ButtonHolder`` is for ``uni_form`` template_pack, while ``FormActions`` is for ``bootstrap`` template pack.

Let's add a layout to our helper::

    from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
    from crispy_forms.layout import Layout, Fieldset

    class ExampleForm(forms.Form):
        [...]
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.helper = FormHelper()
            self.helper.layout = Layout(
                Fieldset(
                    'first arg is the legend of the fieldset',
                    'like_website',
                    'favorite_number',
                    'favorite_color',
                    'favorite_food',
                    'notes'
                ),
                ButtonHolder(
                    Submit('submit', 'Submit', css_class='button white')
                )
            )
            super(ExampleForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

When we render the form now using::

    {% load crispy_forms_tags %}
    {% crispy example_form %}

We will get the fields wrapped in a fieldset, whose legend will be set to 'first arg is the legend of the fieldset'. The fields' order will be: ``like_website``, ``favorite_number``, ``favorite_color``, ``favorite_food`` and ``notes``. We also get a submit button wrapped in a ``<div class="buttonHolder">`` which uni-form CSS positions in a nice way. That button has its CSS class set to ``button white``.

This is just the tip of the iceberg: now imagine you want to add an explanation for what notes are, you can use ``HTML`` layout object::

    Layout(
        Fieldset(
            'Tell us your favorite stuff {{ username }}',
            'like_website',
            'favorite_number',
            'favorite_color',
            'favorite_food',
            HTML("""
                <p>We use notes to get better, <strong>please help us {{ username }}</strong></p> 
            """),
            'notes'
        )
    )

As you'll notice the fieldset legend is context aware and you can write it as if it were a chunk of a template where the form will be rendered. The ``HTML`` object will add a message before the notes input and it's also context aware. Note how you can wrap layout objects into other layout objects. Layout objects ``Fieldset``, ``Div``, ``MultiField`` and ``ButtonHolder`` can hold other Layout objects within. Let's do an alternative layout for the same form::

    Layout(
        MultiField(
            'Tell us your favorite stuff {{ username }}',
            Div(
                'like_website',
                'favorite_number',
                css_id = 'special-fields'
            ),
            'favorite_color',
            'favorite_food',
            'notes'
        )
    )

This time we are using a ``MultiField``, which is a layout object that as a general rule can be used in the same places as ``Fieldset``. The main difference is that this renders all the fields wrapped in a div and when there are errors in the form submission, they are shown in a list instead of each one surrounding the field. Sometimes the best way to see what layout objects do, is just try them and play with them a little bit.


.. _`layout objects`:

Universal layout objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These ones live in module ``crispy_forms.layout``. These are layout objects that are not specific to a template pack. We'll go one by one, showing usage examples:

- **Div**: It wraps fields in a ``<div>``::

    Div('form_field_1', 'form_field_2', 'form_field_3', ...)

**NOTE** Mainly in all layout objects you can set kwargs that will be used as HTML attributes. As ``class`` is a reserved keyword in Python, for it you will have to use ``css_class``. For example::

    Div('form_field_1', style="background: white;", title="Explication title", css_class="bigdivs")

- **HTML**: A very powerful layout object. Use it to render pure html code. In fact it behaves as a Django template and it has access to the whole context of the page where the form is being rendered. This layout object doesn't accept any extra parameters than the html to render, you cannot set html attributes like in ``Div``::

    HTML("{% if success %} <p>Operation was successful</p> {% endif %}")

- **Field**: Extremely useful layout object. You can use it to set attributes in a field or render a specific field with a custom template. This way you avoid having to explicitly override the field's widget and pass an ugly ``attrs`` dictionary::

    Field('password', id="password-field", css_class="passwordfields", title="Explanation")
    Field('slider', template="custom-slider.html")

This layout object can be used to easily extend Django's widgets.

- **Submit**: Used to create a submit button. First parameter is the ``name`` attribute of the button, second parameter is the ``value`` attribute::

    Submit('search', 'SEARCH')
    Submit('search', 'SEARCH')

Renders to::
    
    <input type="submit" name="search" value="SEARCH" class="submit submitButton" id="submit-id-search" />

- **Hidden**: Used to create a hidden input::

    Hidden('name', 'value')

- **Button**: Creates a button::
    
    Button('name', 'value')
    
- **Reset**: Used to create a reset input::

    reset = Reset('name', 'value')

- **Fieldset**: It wraps fields in a ``<fieldset>``. The first parameter is the text for the fieldset legend, as we've said it behaves like a Django template::

    Fieldset("Text for the legend {{ username }}",
        'form_field_1',
        'form_field_2'
    )

Uni-form layout objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These ones live in module ``crispy_forms.layout``. Probably in the future they will be moved out to a ``uni_form`` module:

- **ButtonHolder**: It wraps fields in a ``<div class=”buttonHolder”>``, which uni-form positions in a nice way. This is where form's submit buttons go in uni-form::

    ButtonHolder(
        HTML("<span class="hidden">✓ Saved data</span>"),
        Submit('save', 'Save')
    )

- **MultiField**: It wraps fields in a ``<div>`` with a label on top. When there are errors in the form submission it renders them in a list instead of each one surrounding the field::

    MultiField("Text for the label {{ username }}",
        'form_field_1',
        'form_field_2'
    )

Bootstrap Layout objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ones live in module ``crispy_forms.bootstrap``.

- **FormActions**: It wraps fields in a ``<div class="form-actions">``. This is a bootstrap layout object to wrapp form's submit buttons::

    FormActions(
        Submit('save', 'save', css_class="btn-primary")
    )

- **AppendedText**: It renders a bootstrap appended text input. The first parameter is the name of the field to add appended text to, then the appended text which can be HTML like. There is an optional parameter ``active``, by default set to ``False``, that you can set to a boolean to render appended text active::

    AppendedText('field_name', 'appended text to show')
    AppendedText('field_name', 'appended text to show', active=True)

- **PrependedText**: It renders a bootstrap prepended text input. The first parameter is the name of the field to add prepended text to, then the prepended text which can be HTML like. There is an optional parameter ``active``, by default set to ``False``, that you can set to a boolean to render prepended text active::

    PrependedText('field_name', '<b>Prepended text</b> to show')


Overriding layout objects templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mentioned set of :ref:`layout objects` has been thoroughly designed to be flexible, standard compatible and support Django form features. Every Layout object is associated to a different template that lives in ``templates/{{ TEMPLATE_PACK_NAME }}/layout/`` directory.

Some advanced users may want to use their own templates, to adapt the layout objects to their use or necessities. There are three ways to override the template that a layout object uses. 

- **Globally**: You override the template of the layout object, for all instances of that layout object you use::

    from crispy_forms.layout import Div
    Div.template = 'my_div_template.html'

- **Individually**: You can override the template for a specific layout object in a layout::

    Layout(
        Div(
            'field1',
            'field2',
            template = 'my_div_template.html'
        )
    )

- **Overriding templates directory**: This means copying the templates directory into your project and overriding the templates editing them.

Overriding project templates 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to differentiate between layout objects' templates and django-crispy-forms templates. There are some templates that live in ``templates/{{ TEMPLATE_PACK_NAME }}`` that define the form/formset structure, how a field or errors are rendered, etc. They add very little logic and are pretty much basic wrappers for the rest of django-crispy-forms power.

You can overwrite the templates that django-crispy-forms comes geared with using your own. If you have a template pack based on a CSS library, submit it so more people can benefit from it.

Creating your own layout objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`layout objects` bundled with django-crispy-forms are a set of the most seen components that build a form. You will probably be able to do anything you need combining them. Anyway, you may want to create your own components, for doing that, you will need a good grasp of django-crispy-forms. Every layout object must have a method called ``render``. Its prototype should be::

    def render(self, form, form_style, context):

The official layout objects live in ``layout.py`` and ``bootstrap.py``, you may want to have a look at them to fully understand how to proceed. But in general terms, a layout object is a template rendered with some parameters passed.

If you come up with a good idea and design a layout object you think others could benefit from, please open an issue or send a pull request, so django-crispy-forms gets better.


Inheriting layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine you have several forms that share a big chunk of the same layout. There is a way you can create a ``Layout``, reuse and extend it in an easy way. You can have a ``Layout`` as a component of another ``Layout``, let's see an example::

    common_layout = Layout(
        MultiField("User data",
            'username',
            'lastname',
            'age'
        )
    )

    example_layout = Layout(
        common_layout,
        Div(
            'favorite_food',
            'favorite_bread',
            css_id = 'favorite-stuff'
        )
    )

    example_layout2 = Layout(
        common_layout,
        Div(
            'professional_interests',
            'job_description', 
        )
    )

We have defined a ``common_layout`` that is used as a base for two different layouts: ``example_layout`` and ``example_layout2``, which means that those two layouts will start the same way and then extend the layout in different ways. 


Updating layouts on the go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Layouts can be changed, adapted and generated dynamically. At the moment, ``Layout`` doesn't have an API for handling this, so as in Django forms you will need to access inner attribute ``fields``. Main difference compared to Django forms is that ``fields`` is a Python list and not a dictionary. To sum up all layout objects and ``Layout`` itself hold a ``fields`` list that you can tamper. You can access the layout attached to a helper with::

    form.helper.layout

This is how you would add one layout object at the end of the layout::

    layout.fields.append(HTML("<p>whatever</p>"))

This is how you would add several layout objects::

    layout.fields.extend([
        HTML("<p>whatever</p>"),
        Div('add_field_on_the_go')
    ])

This is how you would replace a layout object::

    layout.fields[2] = HTML("<p>whatever</p>")

This is how you would delete the second layout object::

    layout.fields.pop(1)

This is how you would insert a layout object in the second position::

    layout.fields.insert(1, HTML("<p>whatever</p>"))

.. Warning ::

    Remember always that if you are going to manipulate a helper or layout in a view or any part of your code, you better use an instance level variable.

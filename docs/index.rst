Forms have never been this crispy
=================================

django-crispy-forms provides you with a ``|crispy`` filter and ``{% crispy %}`` tag that will let you control the rendering behavior of your Django_ forms in a very elegant and DRY way. Have full control without writing custom form templates. All this without breaking the standard way of doing things in Django_, so it plays nice with any other form application.

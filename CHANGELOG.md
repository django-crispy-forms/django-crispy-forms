list.

## 2.0 (2023-02-13)
Release of django-crispy-forms 2.0. No changes introduced since 2.0a1.

## 2.0a1 (2023-01-18)

# Major Changes and Migration Guide
* Removed all Bootstrap template packs. These template packs are now available as standalone packages.
  To upgrade, install the required template pack and add it to your
  [`INSTALLED_APPS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS) setting.

    * Boostrap 2: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/crispy-forms-bootstrap2/) -- [GitHub](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-forms-bootstrap2)
    * Boostrap 3: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/crispy-bootstrap3/) -- [GitHub](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-bootstrap3)
    * Boostrap 4: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/crispy-bootstrap4/) -- [GitHub](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-bootstrap4)

  Also, support for Bootstrap 5 is provided by a 3rd party package under the `django-crispy-forms` organisation at
  [crispy-bootstrap5](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-bootstrap5).

* Removed uni-form template pack. Uni-Form specific classes previously added to every template pack e.g. `textInput` are now removed.
  If you require these classes, the previous behaviour can be restored by adding the following to [CRISPY_CLASS_CONVERTERS](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crispy_tag_forms.html#change-crispy-forms-input-default-classes) in your settings file.

  ```
    converters = {
      "textinput": "textinput textInput",
      "fileinput": "fileinput fileUpload",
      "passwordinput": "textinput textInput",
  }
  ```

* The `uni-form` template pack allowed for rendering of templates using a `default` or `inline` layout. As the `uni-form` template
  pack has been removed support for this has also been removed. This has resulted in the following **BREAKING** changes.

    * The `form_style` attribute of `FormHelper` is removed.
    * The `form_style` positional argument to `render_field()` is removed.
    * The `form_style` positional argument to the `render()` method of all `LayoutObjects` is removed.

  Audit for use of `render()` and `render_field()` due to the removal of the `form_style` positional argument is therefore
  required. For example:

  ```
  # django-crispy-forms 1.x
  html = my_layout_object.render(form, form_style, context)
  # django-crispy-forms 2.x
  html = my_layout_object.render(form, context)
  ```

* Widespread use of the `|safe` in crispy-form templates is removed. Audit for html input in your forms
  especially for Field and Prepended/Appended text. To retain the previous behaviour mark text as safe
  in your project code using
  [`mark_safe()`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/utils/#django.utils.safestring.mark_safe). Refs #296.

# Other Changes
* Dropped support for Django 2.2.
* Added support for Django 4.1 and 4.2.
* Added support for Python 3.11.
* The `flat_attrs()` method of `FormActions` is removed. Attributes provided by `**kwargs` are now passed via the `flat_attrs` function during `__init__()` instead of with each call of `render()`
* The `html5_required` attribute of `FormHelper` is removed. In all supported versions of Django the `required` attribute is provided by the core `forms` module.
* The `FormActions` layout object learnt a `css_id` kwarg to add an `id` to the rendered `<div>`
* The default values of "form_error_title" and "formset_error_title" of FormHelper changed from `None` to `""`.
* An attribute error is now raised if the `CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK` setting is not provided.
* The `get_layout_objects()` and `get_field_names()` functions of `LayoutObject` now return a list of `Pointers` rather than a list
  of lists. Pointers are a `dataclass` containing a list of `posistions` and the `name` of object/field.

* Updated compatibility for Django 1.11, 2.1, 2.2 and 3.0 in line with Django's
  supported versions policy.
* Numerous improvements to the Bootstrap 4 template pack, which may now be
  considered mature.

  Here are some changes that might affect custom templating you already have in
  place when using Bootstrap 4 :

    * Using [Custom Forms for radio and checkbox](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_forms_custom.asp).
      You may disable this by setting  `FormHelper.use_custom_control = False`.
    * Using [Bootstrap 4 `"form-row"` class in place of `"row"`](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/forms/#form-row).
    * Fixing [layout hierarchy between input and its label for checkbox and radio](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#checkboxes-and-radios).

 * Updated test suite for compatibility with all supported Django versions 1.4, 1.7, 1.8 and run CI against these and Django `master`. See #451, #455.

 * First `AccordionGroup` can now be set to `active=False`, see #246.

 * All forms are now rendered with {{ form.media }}, this makes forms containing widgets with `Media` meta class work, see #263.
 * Adjusted `{% specialspaceless %}` to avoid breaking intended spaces and be less aggressive, see #250.
 * Fixed inputs rendering for bootstrap3 and redo `FormActions` layout object bootstrap3 template for correct alignment, see #279.

    - `MultiField` cannot be used with `bootstrap` or `bootstrap3` template packs.
    - Added `template_pack` `FormHelper` attribute, so that template packs can be specified at form helper level. This changes layout objects `render` behavior.

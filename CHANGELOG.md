# CHANGELOG for django-crispy-forms

## 1.5.0

Special thanks in this release for all the **<a href="http://flattr.com/thing/512037/django-crispy-forms">supporters and donators</a>**.

 * Fixed compatibilty with: Python 3, Django 1.7, Django 1.8 and Django 1.4.16. Merged PR #417, but thanks to PRs #369, #368 and #310. Closes also #383.

This release had a development stop of more than a year. Basically this was due to a burnout of the maintainer after more than 3 years of continuous development, having less free time to do open source and some personal issues along the way. I'm putting a 1.5.0 release back on track as soon as possible and I'm trying to prevent neglecting development again. I'm sorry to all of you that haven't received an answer in a timely fashion or were frustrated because of your dependence on crispy-forms.

 * Bug fix for specifying `template_pack` in `{% crispy %}` tag, `bootstrap3` couldn't be set that way.
 * New doc section for creating custom template packs.
 * Fixed Bootstrap3 checkbox alignment issues with label texts, see #275.
 * First `AccordionGroup` can now be set to `active=False`, see #246.
 * Fixed Bootstrap3 checkbox alignment issues for all device sizes, see #225 and #267.
 * All forms are now rendered with {{ form.media }}, this makes forms containing widgets with `Media` meta class work, see #263.
 * Adjusted `{% specialspaceless %}` to avoid breaking intended spaces and be less agressive, see #250.
 * Fixed inputs rendering for bootstrap3 and redo `FormActions` layout object bootstrap3 template for correct alignment, see #279.
 * `MultiField` now obeys `form_show_labels`, see #278.
 * Added `wrapper_class` to `bootstrap.InlineRadios`, see #272.
 * Render label for checkboxes within `table_inline_formset.html`, see #262.
 * Removed deprecated layout object `AppendedPrependedText`, replaced by `PrependedAppendedText`.
 * Fixed `PrependedAppendedText` when rendering a select widget, in bootstrap and bootstrap3 template packs, see #258.
 * Added support to `{% crispy_addon %}` tag for `form_show_labels`, see #256.
 * Major cleanup and refactor of the template pack system thanks to @tepez, see #217 and #237:
    - Template packs are now self contained/independent, removing dangerous cross references. If you have a custom template pack this can cause backwards incompatibility, but it will pay in the future to adjust to this changes.
    - `MultiField` cannot be used with `bootstrap` or `bootstrap3` template packs.
    - Added `template_pack` `FormHelper` attribute, so that template packs can be specified at form helper level. This changes layout objects `render` behavior.
 * Default template pack is now `bootstrap3`.
 * Make `CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK` setting optional, see #237 and #244.
